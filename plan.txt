Each player will be its own object
- will hold an array of their chess pieces
- will have an advancing direction to determine where the pawns should go
- ammount of time spent on their turn


Each chess piece will be an object that has a 
- position on the board in the form of [x, y] x rows y columns index
- Type of the piece ie rook king knight etc



type of piece will help determine 
possible moves = the array of all possible moves of the piece given the current board state
